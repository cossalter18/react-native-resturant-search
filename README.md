# React-Native-Resturant-Search

This application was built to familiarize myself with React-Native and to explore the possiblites. 
Wanting to gear my knowledge towards iOS development I felt this was a good app to start with. 
Built along side Udemy React Native course.


## Welcome to the React-Native Resturant search app!

This app is designed for you to search for foods in your area. It is tied to Yelp's API and returns resturants that have been broken down into catergories of cost effective or 1 '$' sign on yelp, Bit pricier, or, 2 '$' signs on Yelp and lastly Big Spender, which is related to 3 '$' signs from Yelp.

Inside the useResults component on line 19 you will have to set your own location. The location is hardcoded in as there is no geo-location technologies in this application.
